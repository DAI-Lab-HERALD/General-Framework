In order to obtain the data used for ETH/UCY, refer to https://github.com/cschoeller/constant_velocity_pedestrian_motion/tree/master/data.

The data should have the following five folders for each of the sub-datasets:

- eth_hotel
- eth_univ
- ucy_univ
- ucy_zara01
- ucy_zara02

Each of the five folders contains:

- data
- dataset_info.json

where data contains i.json files.

For each of the sub-datasets, the number of .json files is:

- eth_hotel: i is in the range of 1 to 1168
- eth_univ: i is in the range of 1 to 876
- ucy_univ: i is in the range of 1 to 984
- ucy_zara01: i is in the range of 1 to 872
- ucy_zara02: i is in the range of 1 to 1052

After placing the data in the /data/ folder, one has to execute the [ETH_processing.py](https://github.com/julianschumann/General-Framework/blob/main/Framework/Data_sets/ETH_pedestrians/ETH_processing.py) script in the folder above for preprocessing.
