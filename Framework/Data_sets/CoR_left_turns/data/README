The L-GAP dataset can be downloaded at [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/file/80e7f503-2471-4f06-be03-9d620a2a5495/0a77d88b-15df-47aa-92c9-d141baf6a2b1) as  CoR_data_raw.zip file.

This file has to be extracted into this /data/ folder, which then should include the following files:
- measures.csv 
- processed_data.csv

Afterward, one has to execute the [CoR_processing.py](https://github.com/julianschumann/General-Framework/blob/main/Framework/Data_sets/CoR_left_turns/CoR_processing.py) script in its folder above for preprocessing.
