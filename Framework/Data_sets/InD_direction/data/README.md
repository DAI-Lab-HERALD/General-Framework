In order to obtain the raw data, refer to the instructions at https://www.ind-dataset.com/.

The data should include the following files:

- xx_background.png
- xx_recordingMeta.csv
- xx_tracks.csv
- xx_trackMeta.csv

where xx ranges from 00 to 32.

After placing the raw data in the /data/ folder, one has to execute the [InD_processing.py](https://github.com/julianschumann/General-Framework/blob/main/Framework/Data_sets/InD_direction/InD_processing.py) script in the folder above for preprocessing.
