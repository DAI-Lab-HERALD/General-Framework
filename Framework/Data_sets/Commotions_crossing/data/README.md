The COMMOTIONS Urban Interactions Driving Simulator Study Dataset can be downloaded at [OSF](https://osf.io/jmn7h) as the Data.zip file.

This file has to be extracted into this /data/ folder, which then should include the folders subx with x ranging from 1 to 80, each containing the .txt log files for the simulated agents.

Afterward, one has to execute the [Commotions_processing.py](https://github.com/julianschumann/General-Framework/blob/main/Framework/Data_sets/Commotions_crossing/Commotions_processing.py) script in its folder above for preprocessing.
