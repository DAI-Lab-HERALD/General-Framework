# Adding a new model to the framework

One can easily add a new model to the Framework by implementing this model as a new class.

## Setting up the class

This class, and by it the model, interacts with the other parts of the Framework using the [model_template.py](https://github.com/julianschumann/General-Framework/blob/main/Framework/Models/model_template.py).
