# Adding a new evaluation metric to the framework

One can easily add a new evaluation metric to the Framework, by implementing this metric as a new class.

## Setting up the class

This class, and by it the evaluation metric, interacts with the other parts of the Framework using the [evaluation_template.py](https://github.com/julianschumann/General-Framework/blob/main/Framework/Evaluation_metrics/evaluation_template.py). Therefore, the new <eval_metric_name>.py file with the class <eval_metric_name> (it is important that those two are the same strings so that the Framework can recognize the evaluation metric) begins in the following way:

```
from evaluation_template import evaluation_template

class <eval_metric_name>(evaluation_template):
  def get_name(self = None):
    r'''
    Provides a dictionary with the different names of the evaluation metric.
        
    Returns
    -------
    names : dict
      The first key of names ('print')  will be primarily used to refer to the evaluation metric in console outputs. 
            
      The 'file' key has to be a string that does not include any folder separators 
      (for any operating system), as it is mostly used to indicate that certain result files belong to this
      evaluation metric. 
            
      The 'latex' key string is used in automatically generated tables and figures for latex, and can there include 
      latex commands - such as using '$$' for math notation.
        
    '''

    names = {'print': '<Eval metric name>',
             'file': '<Eval_metric_name>',
             'latex': r'<\emph{Eval metric} name>'}

    return names
```

Here, the get_name() function creates a dictionary with three keys, the value of each must be a string. The first key is 'print', which will be primarily used to refer to the evaluation metric in console outputs. Meanwhile, the 'file' has to be a string that does not include any folder separators (for any operating system), as it is mostly used to indicate that certain result files belong to this evaluation metric. Finally, the 'latex' key string is used in automatically generated tables and figures for latex, and can include latex commands - such as using '$$' for math notation.

For this class, a number of other prenamed methods need to be defined as well, via which the evaluation metric interacts with the rest of the framework.

## Setting up the evaluation metric

Next, if the evaluation metric requires certain values to be calculated prior to being applied for evaluation this can be done with:

```
  def setup_method(self):
    # Will do any preparation the method might require, like calculating weights.
    # creates:
    # self.weights_saved -  The weights that were created for this metric,
    #                       will be in the form of a list
```
This is primarily intended for computationally heavy calculations of values which can be shared across the evaluation of different models. If no such calculations are required, one can simply write `pass` within the function definition. 
Connected to this, one must also define whether this pre-processing type is even required for the desired evaluation metric. This is done in:

```
  def requires_preprocessing(self):
    r''' 
    If True, then the function *setup_method* will be called and therefore has to be defined.
        
    Returns
    -------
    preprocessing_decision : bool
        
    '''
    return preprocessing_decision
```

## Define metric type
In the next step, it is necessary to define the type of metric. Most important in the interactions with the rest of the framework is the type of output produced by the model that the metric evaluates:

```    
  def get_output_type(self = None):
    r'''
    This returns a string with the output type:
    The possibilities are:
    'path_all_wo_pov' : Predicted trajectories of all agents except the pov agent (defined
    in scenario), if this is for example assumed to be an AV.
    'path_all_wi_pov' : Predicted trajectories of all designated agents, including the pov agent.
    'class' : Predicted probability that some class of behavior will be observable in the future.
    'class_and_time' : Both the aforementioned probabilities, as well as the time at which the
    behavior will become observable.
        
    Returns
    -------
    output_type : str
        
    '''
    return output_type
```
Of the two trajectory prediction methods, *'path_all_wi_pov'* is generally to be preferred, as it does not rely on the existence of a distinguished pov agent, and even if such an agent exists, predicting its future behavior is most often no problem. However, in most cases, switching between those two possibilities should not require any more effort than changing the output of this specific function.


Furthermore, it must also be checked if the metric can be even applied to the selected dataset. For this, the method *check_applicability()* is needed.
If the metric can be applied, it should return None, while otherwise, it should return a string that completes the sentence: "*This metric cannot be applied, because...*".

```    
  def check_applicability(self):
    r'''
    This function potentially returns reasons why the metric is not applicable to the chosen scenario.
        
    Returns
    -------
    reason : str
      This str gives the reason why the metric cannot be used in this instance. If the metric is usable,
      return None instead.
        
    '''
    return reason
```
A potential reason why the metric might not be applicable could be the restriction to a certain scenario (see [*self.data_set.scenario_name*](https://github.com/julianschumann/General-Framework/tree/main/Framework/Scenarios#setting-up-the-class)) or dataset (see [*self.data_set.get_name()*](https://github.com/julianschumann/General-Framework/tree/main/Framework/Data_sets#setting-up-the-class)).


Finally, when comparing metrics, it is important to know if a superior model would minimize or maximize them. For this, the method *get_opt_goal()* is used:
```    
  def get_opt_goal(self):
    r'''
    This function says if better metric values are smaller or larger.
        
    Returns
    -------
    metric_goal : str
      This str gives the goal of comparisons. If **metric_goal** = 'minimize', then a lower metric
      value indicates a better value, while 'maximize' is the other way around. As the framework
      only checks if the return here is 'minimize', any other string would be treated as if it
      was set to 'maximize'.
        
    '''
    return metric_goal
```

Similarly, it is also the case that metric values can have hard limits on what form they can take, such as for example distance metrics, which should not be lower than 0. These limits are defined in the method *metric_boundaries()*:
```
  def metric_boundaries(self = None):
    r'''
    This function informs the framework about any boundaries that a metric value might take.

    Returns
    -------
    boundaries : list
      This is a list with two values, namely [min_value, max_value]. If one of those values
      does not exist, as the metric is unbounded, then one has to set either min_value or
      max_value (or both) equal to *None*.
      
    '''
    return boundaries
```


## Defining the evaluation metric

The most important part of the evaluation module is the definition of how the metric is calculated. This is done within the *evaluate_prediction_method()*.

```
  def evaluate_prediction_method(self):
    r'''
    # Takes true outputs and corresponding predictions to calculate some metric to evaluate a model.

    Returns
    -------
    results : list
      This is a list with at least one entry. The first entry must be a scalar, which allows the comparison
      of different models according to that metric. Afterwards, any information can be saved which might
      be useful for later visualization of the results, if this is so desired.
    '''

    ...
    
    return results 
```

Here, the [helper functions](#useful-helper-functions) can be used to load the true and predicted data, with the choice depending on the type of metric.


## Metric Visualization
The framework includes some tools for visualizing metrics. One is the plotting of the final metric values. As in some cases, there can be large differences in the metric results between different models, it can be helpful to represent the metric results on a log scale rather than a linear scale for easier readability. In order to determine whether the log_scale is to be used, one has to define this in:
```
  def is_log_scale(self = None):
    r''' 
    If True, then the metric values will be plotted on a logarithmic y-axis.
        
    Returns
    -------
    log_scale_decision : bool
        
    '''
    return log_scale_decision
```

Additionally, some metrics such as the various ECE metrics have additional information that can be plotted. In order to inform the framework if such information exists and can be plotted, one needs to define it through: 

```
  def allows_plot(self):
    r''' 
    If True, then plots such as calibration curves will be created.
        
    Returns
    -------
    plot_decision : bool
        
    '''
    return plot_decision
```

If this function *allow_plots()* returns *True*, then one also needs to define a function that actually executes this plotting.

```
  def create_plot(self, results, test_file, fig, ax, save = False, model_class = None):
    '''
    This function creates the final plot.
    
    This function is cycled over all included models, so they can be combined
    in one figure. However, it is also possible to save a figure for each model,
    if so desired. In that case, a new instance of fig and ax should be created and
    filled instead of the ones passed as parameters of this functions, as they are
    shared between all models.
    
    If only one figure is created over all models, this function should end with:
        
    if save:
      ax.legend() # Depending on if this is desired or not
      fig.show()
      fig.savefig(test_file, bbox_inches='tight')  

    Parameters
    ----------
    results : list
      This is the list produced by self.evaluate_prediction_method().
    test_file : str
      This is the location at which the combined figure of all models can be
      saved (it ends with '.pdf'). If one saves a result for each separate model, 
      one should adjust the filename to indicate the actual model.
    fig : matplotlib.pyplot.Figure
      This is the overall figure that is shared between all models.
    ax : matplotlib.pyplot.Axes
      This is the overall axis that is shared between all models.
    save : bool, optional
      This is the trigger that indicates if one currently is plotting the last
      model, which should indicate that the figure should now be saved. The default is False.
    model_class : Framework_Model, optional
      The model for which the current results were calculated. The default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    None.

## Useful helper functions
For the evaluation, the following functions are provided by the evaluation template to allow for easier access 
to the true and predicted data.

```
